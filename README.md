In this project, I have performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Starbucks stock prices to gain insights into the companyâ€™s performance in the Index Markets. I have analyzed the stock prices over the past 30 years and identified trends and patterns that can help us understand investorsâ€™ sentiment towards Starbucks stocks.
